# Client-Server Simplified Message Queuing

This program is a simplified message queueing program that
allows a client to connect to different queues through a proxie
queue and allows the client to put messages into these queues
as well as listing and retrieving messages from the queues.


# Usage

To build both the client and server programs enter 'make' into the
terminal command line.
$ make

Then open two different terminal windows and run the server in one
and run the client in the other one.

To run the server:
$ ./server create queue <queue name>

To run the client program:
$ ./client <server IP address> <server port number>

The server must be runnning before the client can connect to it.

# Server commands

To bind to another queue:

server> bind <queue name> <queue IP address> <queue port number>

A server can bind to one queue at a time by typing its name, its
IP address, and its port number into the command line.

Before the server can accept any messages from the client, it
must bind to the queues it needs.  Once the user is done binding
queues just return and the server will start listening for a client.

# Client commands

To put messages into a queue:

client> put <queue name> <queue name> ... "message"

A client can put a message into as many queues as desired by
specifying the queue names in the command line.

To retrieve a message from a queue:

client> get <queue name>

A client can only retrieve one message at a time from one queue.

To see how many messages a queue has:

client> list <queue name>

A client can only list the number of message of one queue at a time.
